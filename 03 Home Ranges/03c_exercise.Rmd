Let's apply what we've learned about home ranges. Refer to the lecture slides (<a href="03a_lecture.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">03a_lecture.html</a>) and the walkthrough code (`03b_walkthrough.R`) as a refresher.

We encourage you to use your own data for this exercise. We will be available while you are working to answer any questions.

If you don't have your own data, you can use example data built into `amt`. You can access the fisher data like this:

```{r amt_fisher, eval = FALSE}
# Load `amt`
library(amt)

# Location data as 'track_xyt'
dat <- amt_fisher

```

You likely have more than one individual in your own data, and `amt_fisher` also has 4 individuals. We will cover multiple instances in the next module. If you want to try to handle multiple individuals, please do! But you might want to master the home range concepts using just a single individual.

## Instructions

1. Load in your data or the `amt_fisher` dataset. If you're working with your own data, format it as a `track_xyt` object using `amt::make_track()`.
  
2. Fit a home range of your choice for this individual (feel free to fit more than one home range type). Fit at least two isopleths per home range, *e.g.*, 95% and 50%. 
    
3. Compute the area of each home range polygon. Convert the area to reasonable units for your study animal, such as ha or km^2^.
  
4. Make a map with that individual's home range. If you are trying with multiple individuals, it's up to you whether you want all your individuals on a single map or one map per individual.
