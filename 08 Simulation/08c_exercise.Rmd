Let's apply what we've learned about simulating from fitted iSSFs. 

## Instructions

In the second part of the code walkthrough, we simulated trajectories from scratch (i.e., without fitting a model before). Repeat this, but now with a selection of 0 for $x$. Simulate 50 trajectories and smooth the locations of these trajectories after 5, 10 and 15 steps. In crease the realism of this by adding a random starting direction.
