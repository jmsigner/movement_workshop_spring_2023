# We will use an example data set of a African buffalo here. This data set has
# been used as a case study in many other papers.
cilla <- read_rds("data/cilla.rds")

# The first step is to prepare the data to fit an iSSF model. `cilla` is already
# and `amt` track.

  extract_covariates(env, where = "both") %>% 
  mutate(hour = hour(t1_) + minute(t1_) / 60) %>% 
  filter(complete.cases(.))

# Modelling ----
# ... First model ----
# Next, we fit a model with all movement relevant covariates for full movement
# kernel and only one habitat covariate (the distance to water).

# ... Simulation ---- 
# We have to define a start step (i.e., we need the start coordinates, a
# direction and sampling rate, which will be used for all consecutive steps).
start <- make_start(ssf_cilla[1, ])

# We can then create a redistribution kernel (i.e., a probability surface of
# where the animal will move next).

# of consecutive steps). We will simulate 500 steps. It should take approx 150
# seconds to run.

# We see that the trajectory shows some kind of home-range behavior.

# Second model ----- 
# We will make the model now slightly more complex and add home ranging behavior
# (credits for this way to consider home-ranging behavior are to Chris
# Flemming). We include x2_, y2_ and their squared product in the model and this
# will pull the animal always back.

plot(env1[["water_crossed"]])
lines(cilla$x_, cilla$y_)
lines(s3$x_, s3$y_, col = "red")

# More complex model ---- 
# The function `redistribution_kernel()` has a further argument that is called
# `fun`. By default, fun will extract all covariates provided by `map` at the
# beginning and at the end. But we could pass another function. Lets revisit the
# previous example and do the calculation -- whether or not the buffalo crossed
# the river -- before. And save this result in a new variable called `crossed`.
