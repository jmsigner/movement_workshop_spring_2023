	abstract = {For gregarious animals the cost-benefit trade-offs that drive habitat selection may vary dynamically with group size, which plays an important role in foraging and predator avoidance strategies. We examined how habitat selection by bison (Bison bison) varied as a function of group size and interpreted these patterns by testing whether habitat selection was more strongly driven by the competing demands of forage intake vs. predator avoidance behavior. We developed an analytical framework that integrated group size into resource selection functions (RSFs). These group-size-dependent RSFs were based on a matched case-control design and were estimated using conditional logistic regression (mixed and population-averaged models). Fitting RSF models to bison revealed that bison groups responded to multiple aspects of landscape heterogeneity and that selection varied seasonally and as a function of group size. For example, roads were selected in summer, but not in winter. Bison groups avoided areas of high snow water equivalent in winter. They selected areas composed of a large proportion of meadow area within a 700-m radius, and within those areas, bison selected meadows. Importantly, the strength of selection for meadows varied as a function of group size, with stronger selection being observed in larger groups. Hence the bison-habitat relationship depended in part on the dynamics of group formation and division. Group formation was most likely in meadows. In contrast, risk of group fission increased when bison moved into the forest and was higher during the time of day when movements are generally longer and more variable among individuals. We also found that stronger selection for meadows by large rather than small bison groups was caused by longer residence time in individual meadows by larger groups and that departure from meadows appears unlikely to result from a depression in food intake rate. These group-size-dependent patterns were consistent with the hypothesis that avoidance of predation risk is the strongest driver of habitat selection.},

	abstract = {“Species distribution modeling” was recently ranked as one of the top five “research fronts” in ecology and the environmental sciences by ISI’s Essential Science Indicators (Renner and Warton 2013), reflecting the importance of predicting how species distributions will respond to anthropogenic change. Unfortunately, species distribution models (SDMs) often perform poorly when applied to novel environments. Compounding on this problem is the shortage of methods for evaluating SDMs (hence, we may be getting our predictions wrong and not even know it). Traditional methods for validating SDMs quantify a model’s ability to classify locations as used or unused. Instead, we propose to focus on how well SDMs can predict the characteristics of used locations. This subtle shift in viewpoint leads to a more natural and informative evaluation and validation of models across the entire spectrum of SDMs. Through a series of examples, we show how simple graphical methods can help with three fundamental challenges of habitat modeling: identifying missing covariates, non-linearity, and multicollinearity. Identifying habitat characteristics that are not well-predicted by the model can provide insights into variables affecting the distribution of species, suggest appropriate model modifications, and ultimately improve the reliability and generality of conservation and management recommendations.},

	abstract = {A resource selection function (RSF) is any model that yields values proportional to the probability of use of a resource unit. RSF models often are fitted using generalized linear models (GLMs) although a variety of statistical models might be used. Information criteria such as the Akaike Information Criteria (AIC) or Bayesian Information Criteria (BIC) are tools that can be useful for selecting a model from a set of biologically plausible candidates. Statistical inference procedures, such as the likelihood-ratio test, can be used to assess whether models deviate from random null models. But for most applications of RSF models, usefulness is evaluated by how well the model predicts the location of organisms on a landscape. Predictions from RSF models constructed using presence/absence (used/ unused) data can be evaluated using procedures developed for logistic regression, such as confusion matrices, Kappa statistics, and Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves. However, RSF models estimated from presence/ available data create unique problems for evaluating model predictions. For presence/available models we propose a form of k-fold cross validation for evaluating prediction success. This involves calculating the correlation between RSF ranks and area-adjusted frequencies for a withheld sub-sample of data. A similar approach can be applied to evaluate predictive success for out-of-sample data. Not all RSF models are robust for application in different times or different places due to ecological and behavioral variation of the target organisms.},

	abstract = {A coefficient of explained randomness, analogous to explained variation but for non-linear models, was presented by Kent. The construct hinges upon the notion of Kullback-Leibler information gain. Kent and O'Quigley developed these ideas, obtaining simple, multiple and partial coefficients for the situation of proportional hazards regression. Their approach was based upon the idea of transforming a general proportional hazards model to a specific one of Weibull form. Xu and O'Quigley developed a more direct approach, more in harmony with the semi-parametric nature of the proportional hazards model thereby simplifying inference and allowing, for instance, the use of time dependent covariates. A potential drawback to the coefficient of Xu and O'Quigley is its interpretation as explained randomness in the covariate given time. An investigator might feel that the interpretation of the Kent and O'Quigley coefficient, as a proportion of explained randomness of time given the covariate, is preferable. One purpose of this note is to indicate that, under an independent censoring assumption, the two population coefficients coincide. Thus the simpler inferential setting for Xu and O'Quigley can also be applied to the coefficient of Kent and O'Quigley. Our second purpose is to point out that a sample-based coefficient in common use in the SAS statistical package can be interpreted as an estimate of explained randomness when there is no censoring. When there is censoring the SAS coefficient would not seem satisfactory in that its population counterpart depends on an independent censoring mechanism. However there is a quick fix and we argue in favour of its use. Copyright © 2004 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},
